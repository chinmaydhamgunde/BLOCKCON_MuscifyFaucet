Users can use faucets to receive new tokens or coins. New blockchain projects frequently use this method to distribute their tokens to a larger audience 
and generate interest in their project.

While the amount of cryptocurrency received from a faucet is usually very small, they can be useful for users who want to test out a new cryptocurrency or 
blockchain project without investing any money.

This Faucet distributes 1 Music token every 6 Hr/(Per User) 

The ERC20 contract is written in such a way that for every successful faucet , 1 Music token is minted and added to supply. Token has a max supply of 100000.
